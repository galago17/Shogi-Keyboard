# A Keyboard for Shogi Notation

## Keymap
In general, a key without modifiers is a major piece that is moved often, a key with option is a less common piece starting with the same letter, and a key with shift is the promotion of the key without shift, but only if that promoted piece is not in the starting layout in its unpromoted form. The layout is based on chu shogi, with the addition of the knight to make it compatible with standard shogi.
